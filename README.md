用於自動化處理ISCE遙測影像
## exe_isce.py
exe_isce.py can perform bulk filtering and automatic batch processing of remote sensing images.
Please note that running the tool will overwrite the 'AllTest' folder. If you want to keep it, adjustments need to be made separately.
## multi3_exeisce.py and multi2_exeisce.py
These can filter remote sensing images and automatically process the merging of multiple images.
## outputTIFv3.py
outputTIFv3.py can convert the result images into TIF files. Detailed settings can be found through the code comments inside the program.
## area_select2.py
area_select2.py allows for the setting of latitude and longitude to filter target areas within remote sensing images.
## remainingfile.py
remainingfile.py can continue processing calculations for remote sensing images that have not yet been executed.
